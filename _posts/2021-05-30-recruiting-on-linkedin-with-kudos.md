Recruiting on Linkedin with Kudos. Search on Linkedin using kudos, kudos categories, and profile keywords.

I've seen on my Linkedin feed that people appreciate a team member using the hashtag `#kudos` and a kudos category hashtag.

Here is the official document where Linkedin explain how Kudos works. [Kudos on Linkedin](https://blog.linkedin.com/2018/june/12/introducing-linkedin-kudos-say-thanks-and-show-your-appreciation)

## Recruiting on Linkedin with Kudos

There are 10 kudos category hashtags:

* ThankYou
* GoingAboveAndBeyond
* InspirationalLeader
* TeamPlayer
* GreatJob
* MakingWorkFun
* AmazingMentor
* OutsideTheBoxThinker
* GreatPresentation
* MakingAnImpact

You can use any combination of `#kudos` and a kudos category above for **recruiting on Linkedin** with Kudos.

## Kudos and Kudos Category Links

A boolean search doesn't seem to work to combine the hashtag kudos with all combinations of categories in one line. Also, a Google search for this `site:linkedin.com/in/posts/ inurl:kudos` does not work.

Here are each of the Linkedin URLs for each category.
