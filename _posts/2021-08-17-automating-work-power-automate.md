Save hours of work and increase productivity automating work with Power Automate.

I will show you how to get started in automation, from some basic tasks to more complex workflows.

Power automate is an application provided by Microsoft, and usually available with an outlook email account. You can use Python for automation that requires more complex workflows.

## Power Automate Featured Templates

Let's start with some basic automation tasks using Power Automate. The application comes with templates that you can almost plug and play.

Go to the Power Automate templates [here](https://us.flow.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/)

### 1. Create a task in planner from an MS teams message

Trigger a task in Planner from any message in Microsoft Teams.

Click on the template.

The interface shows that this work flow will connect to:

* Microsoft Teams
* Planner

You must sign in to each of these applications to connect to them. Click on the 'sign in' button next to each.

Then click `Continue`

A form allows you to choose the MS teams channel and the Planner project you want to create tasks for.

The advanced editor shows a more complex interface. This has a much steeper learning curve but you can customize the workflow to anything that you want. You can add steps in the workflow to automate other tasks or create branches to automate tasks in parallel.

Here is the workflow with the main components.

When you expand a component, it can become very complex very fast. To get started it is easier to use the default templates and see what they do.

Sign in to the components.
