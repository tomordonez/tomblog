## IPv6 Issues

In the US. Comcast has IPv6 enabled and this can be an issue.

The best solution is to login to your router. Disable IPv6 and enable IPv4.

If this is not possible. You can try to disable IPv6 from the command line. But if your router doesn't have IPv4 enabled this will not work:

To disable IPv6 from terminal:

    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1

To re-enable IPv6:

    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0

Or edit the file directly with:

    sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf

You can also disable IPv6 from your laptop Wifi Settings.

If you disable IPv6 and you lose internet. Try restarting your laptop Wifi or Wifi card.

## Other issues

The VPN doesn't connect or shows output that a new version is available

    $ sudo dnf update nordvpn

If that doesn't work, restart the service

    $ sudo systemctl stop nordvpnd.service
    $ sudo systemctl start nordvpnd.service
