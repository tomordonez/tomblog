These are things I want to do in 2022.

I started my MS in CS at Georgia Tech about 3 years ago. I completed 5 classes but dropped about other 3 or 4. Three months ago I was on a quest to specialize in machine learning. After taking AI Ethics last fall I learned about the biases of AI/ML algorithms and not sure I want to be part of that quest anymore. While it's good to know some ML. The lack of proper data governance in AI/ML is leading to more biased algorithms.

I switched my specialization again. It was Machine Learning. Then it was Interactive Intelligence (which was basically a bad name for ML Part 2). Now switched to Computing Systems. I believe in having a stronger foundation in CS. I see that languages are all sort of similar. Java, Python, Scala, Javascript. It's rather easy to pick up a language. While ML is basically statistics, math, and algorithms in one package. They can be learned with a strong CS foundation.

I got my roadmap set for the rest of the MS:

* Summer: Network Security
* Fall: Software Architecture and Software Analysis
* Spring '23: Machine Learning
* Fall '23: Advanced Algorithms

## Learning a full tech stack for web/mobile development

ML is very complicated to learn and not in love anymore of being a data scientist. Perhaps a ML engineer but that requires advanced experience in software engineering.

I am reading the Steve Jobs bio...again. In my last attempts I didn't read beyond the first 15% of the book due to lack of time. In one of the chapters I am reading about Jobs obsession with the user interface.

In the following three months I am making my best efforts to learn the tech stack React/Node/GraphQL (and React Native) to build web and mobile apps so I can translate my ideas to products that users can test.

More about my ideas [here](../tasks/).

I am on a quest to learn these:

* JIRA
* Node, React, GraphQL
* Moving from cron to Airflow (Python DAG and Spark jobs in Scala)
* Deploy an app to GCP witk Kubernetes and Terraform
* React Native and deploy an app to the AppStore

## Reading books

These resolutions are rather short term than whole year. I realized when taking a class at GaTech, I usually don't have time for anything else, and that led me to not take any classes this semester.

I will try my best to complete these books:

* Steve Jobs Bio
* Agile estimating and planning
* The Star Schema
* Algorithms Illuminated
* The clean coder
* The pragmatic programmer
* The passionate programmer
* Math for Computer Science
* Information Architecture

## Keeping myself accountable

I use TaskWarrior, a terminal todo app to keep progress of my learning, but I want to publish my todo to the public. Perhaps as a first simple app I can do a todo web app that I can share and anyone can send me feedback or some sort of encouragement or mentorship.

## Interest in finance

I want to learn more about stock market and this could help me for a future class I will take. Perhaps a mobile app related to stocks or crypto.

## Interest in algorithms

I must get a stronger foundation of algorithms this year. Maybe building the snake game using the Node/React stack with a menu to select the type of algorithm to use when playing, with more details of how the algorithm works.

## Interest in data engineering

Looking to get more experience engineering pipelines. Maybe build a web app that collects dozens of sources and publishes a dashboard with some metric.
